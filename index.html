    The purpose of this application is to track the 
    users blood alcohol content/concentration (BAC) 
    during an isolated period of alcohol consumption. 
    The calculation is estimated using an abbreviated 
    version of the Widmark formula known as the 8/10 Method. 
    The userâ€™s BAC at any given time is determined using 
    his or her sex, weight, current number of alcoholic 
    drinks consumed, and the time elapsed since alcohol 
    consumption began.
