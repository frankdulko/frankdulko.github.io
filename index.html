        The purpose of this application is to track the 
        users blood alcohol content/concentration (BAC) 
        during an isolated period of alcohol consumption. 
        The calculation is estimated using an abbreviated 
        version of the Widmark formula known as the 8/10 Method. 
        The userâ€™s BAC at any given time is determined using 
        his or her sex, weight, current number of alcoholic 
        drinks consumed, and the time elapsed since alcohol 
        consumption began.
