      Once authenticated with their phone number, the user is presented with a
      list of businesses in the immediate area. Tapping on one of these
      businesses will bring the user to a feed of posts from other users. The
      user can create their own post or comment on existing posts. Users will be
      prompted to set a username and can also upload a personalized profile
      picture from their camera roll.
