    <p>
      Go to ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com and you will be greeted by a random AI
      generated face. The AI image generator was trained on billions of human
      faces in order to create one that does not exist. This is possible using a
      style-based generative adversarial network (StyleGAN).

      On the other hand, ThisPersonDoesExist.com displays the dataset behind
      this famous architecture. The dataset, known as Flickr-Faces-HQ is a
      collection of high resolution images made available by the NVIDIA
      Corporation under the creative commons license in 2018.

      Can you tell the difference between a real human face and an AI generated
      one? This app offers the opportunity to seamlessly swipe between a face
      picked randomly from either the real dataset or created from “This Person
      Does Not Exist.” Does this person exist? Swipe left for no or right for
      yes!
